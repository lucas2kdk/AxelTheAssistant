# AxelTheAssistant

Axel The Assistant is a Virtual Assistant
made to be Universal with Mac & Windows... possibly Linux in the future.

The project is made by a single person, not a team so development might be slow.

# Installation
Make sure Python 3 is installed
Type pip3 install -r requirements.txt

And then run the Python-file.

# Change Log

### 21-03-2021
I've setup this github got a working base with some basic Folder organization.
So far the Assistant can do absolutly nothing but there's a lot more to go.

# TO DO

### 22-03-2021
Perhaps setup a TrelloBoard instead of this Section
Setup a Development-Branch instead of Pushing to master.
Create actual commands, I'm thinking some selenium-automation.
Design someway to interact, with the assistant without using voice controls.
